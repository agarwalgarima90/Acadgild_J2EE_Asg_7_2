Use of following methods:

1. executeQuery() : Executes the SQL query in the PreparedStatement object and returns the ResultSet object generated by the query. One can iterate over this ResultSet to view the result and print it.

2. executeUpdate() : Executes the SQL statement in this PreparedStatement object, which must be an SQL INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE statement or an SQL statement that returns nothing, such as a DDL statement. If needed one can store the result in an int variable which helps in analysing if the query was executed successfully.

3. next() : It is used as an iterator to iterate over the ResultSet. It fetches the next entry in the set and can be displayed using rs.getString(1) or rs.getInt(1) for example. The parameter defines the column number for which it has to display the data.

Example JDBCExample.java shows the usage.
